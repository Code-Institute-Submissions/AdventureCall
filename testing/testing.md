# Testing

### On all Listed Devices the following tests were performed:

Initial testing was completed on a Macbook Pro running Chrome Browser

### User Stories tests

- As a user/player of the game I want to have a fun experience with some pay off at the end.

This game has been tested on various users including friends and family members.  Most around 30-35 age group.
The users were familiar with the sketch show that the game is based on except for my wife but she enjoyed the
fantasy aspect of the game.  Users felt that there could have been more references to the show and there was
a suggestion that there could have been more interaction between the player and the guide character Falconhoof.
Overall the testers thought that the main objective of the first user story was met as the game was enjoyable to workout
and the little fireworks gif at the end provided a nice bookend to the experience.

After the intial tests I found that it was a bit more intuitive to hit enter to start the initial game after typing in your name so
this funtionality was added into the game to improve user experience.

Below are some gameplay screenshots including the final fireworks sequence.

- As a user/player of the game I want some kind of personalisation of my experience so that I can feel more connected to what is going on.

The option of entering the player's name has been used to personalise the user experience so that the game can speak directly to the 
user.  This can be seen in the fireworks screenshot above and also the intial welcome screens of the game below.
