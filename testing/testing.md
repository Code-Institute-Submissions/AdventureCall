# Testing

### On all Listed Devices the following tests were performed:

Initial testing was completed on a Macbook Pro running Chrome Browser and Samsung S10 phone.

### User Stories tests

- As a user/player of the game I want to have a fun experience with some pay off at the end.

This game has been tested on various users including friends and family members.  Most around 30-35 age group.
The users were familiar with the sketch show that the game is based on except for my wife but she enjoyed the
fantasy aspect of the game.  Users felt that there could have been more references to the show and there was
a suggestion that there could have been more interaction between the player and the guide character Falconhoof.
Overall the testers thought that the main objective of the first user story was met as the game was enjoyable to workout
and the little fireworks gif at the end provided a nice bookend to the experience.

After the intial tests I found that it was a bit more intuitive to hit the enter key to start the initial game after typing in your name so
this funtionality was added into the game to improve user experience.

Below are some gameplay screenshots including the final fireworks sequence.

- As a user/player of the game I want some kind of personalisation of my experience so that I can feel more connected to what is going on.

The option of entering the player's name has been used to personalise the user experience so that the game can speak directly to the 
user.  This can be seen in the fireworks screenshot above and also the intial welcome screens of the game below.

- As a fan of fantasy/role playing games I want references to the tropes associated with these games.

Throughout the game reference is made to common stock characters and situations found within the fantasy/roleplaying genre.  Examples
include Trolls, wizards, golden amulets and castle towers!  This helps to create a familiar world for the user so that they can use their
imagination to immerse themselves in the game.  The pictures used further support this and they were chosen for their fun cartoonish
quality and as good representations of what the text is trying to convey.  This is demonstrated in the moonlit meadow picture above and the death screen shown below.

- As a fan of the original limmy sketch I want to have references to the show so that it will make the game more fun.

Users will find that all the situations that are presented from the games have a basis in the original sketches.  Specifically
the 'Christmas Special' sketch and the 'Greg' sketch.  Users found that the game was lacking in a lot of the humour from the sketches
and it was found to be a bit more serious.  Fans of the show would have preferred at least one sequence with Jingle the Jester of the
famous 'Kill Jester' sketch and as mentioned before more interaction with falconhoof would have improved the experience.  Overall
because of the many references to the show it is felt that the user story above has been achieved.

## Game Walkthrough

- Initial Welcome screen with Falconhoof character in reference to the inspiration sketch, text welcome and space for player to enter name.

- If player enters no name of a blank space they will be prompted to enter a name before continuing.

- Once player enters a valid name next screen is displayed with a personalised welcome for the player using their name.

- The game starts and the first question appears including any image associated with the question.  The buttons appear correctly.

- The player makes choices based on the answer options given and through the game is given the oppotunity to pick up objects which may help them later in the game.  On the screen where character is at the gate of bones when the character does not have the correct items the single button item is still off centre.  Could have written bespoke code to amend this but left is as is even though it jars slightly.  The correct options appear based on which item the player currently holds.

- If the player makes a choice which results in death then they are taken back to the first question without the personalised welcome show again.

- If the player makes all the correct choices and reaches the end of the game they are greeted with a personalised message and a gif of a fireworks display.

- At this stage they are given the chance to start from scratch by hitting the go back to the beginning button and reloading the page and the name is not held.

One user testing the game found the Adventure Call logo was slightly blurry due to the quality of the image used.  Continued to use this image as it was the best quality image I could find of the logo and it really makes the best possible link to the source material.

The following devices were emulated on Google Chrome developer tools running the site with no issues:

It was tested live on iPhone 8 and the user found that they had to zoom in to read on question one.  No amendments made to ensure readability across all other screen sizes.

The Website was tested on the [Troy](http://troy.labs.daum.net/) site using the tests described above with no issues.

Devices emulated are as follows:
